## About the event:

MSC IGDTUW organised a comprehensive discussion about our individual experiences with Outreachy, which I participated in with my co-speaker Nikhila K S. We shared valuable insights and tips to help our peers and juniors navigate the application process for this esteemed open-source internship. Our conversation covered important topics such as how to write a compelling project proposal, the complexities of the final application along with project proposals, and the overall timeline.

We used the opportunity to highlight the numerous benefits of participation, such as the expansion of professional networks, while also providing attendees with a curated list of learning resources. The session concluded with an interactive Q&A segment in which we answered both frequently asked questions and real-time inquiries from the audience, fostering a deeper understanding of this internship.
