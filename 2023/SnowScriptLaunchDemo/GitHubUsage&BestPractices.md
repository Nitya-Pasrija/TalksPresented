## About the event: 
Launched and managed the SnowScript Winter of Code at GDSC IGDTUW, with students actively participating in open-source contributions across a variety of domains, including web development, app development, machine learning, technical writing, data structures, AR/VR, and UI design, across 18 repositories.

During the session, I coveredÂ GitHub's collaborative guidelines, demonstrated how to clone a project and make a first contribution, and talked about creating issues. Furthermore, the program's timeline and prize information were highlighted. Notably, the four-week initiative generated significant engagement, with nearly 350 contributors and over 450 merged pull requests, demonstrating the participants' enthusiasm and productivity, from across 20 colleges all over India.
